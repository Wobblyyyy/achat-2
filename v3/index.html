                a_ch_at is a browser-based chat service. users can create group chats, 
                message other users in direct messages, chat on the global server,
                play games with eachother, earn tokens by using the app to buy cool cosmetics, and more.
                <h3><strong>group chats</strong></h3>
                users can create group chats with other members, with no restrictions on how many users can be in the group.
                every group features many of the same things everything else, including DMs has. you can still earn tokens 
                to spend on <i>epic</i> stuff, and group messages are saved up to 100 messages back.
                <h3><strong>direct messages</strong></h3>
                direct messages are exactly what the name would suggest - a way to talk to one singular person. by default,
                messages in a direct message log are saved up to 50 messages back, but that can be upgraded to 100 or even 200
                with the use of tokens.
                <h3><strong>tokens</strong></h3>
                tokens are earned through very mysterious ways. you can pay other users tokens, use tokens to buy cosmetics, or
                use tokens to upgrade whichever chats you'd like.
                <h3><strong>shop</strong></h3>
                a_ch_at's shop allows you to spend your hard-earned tokens on a variety of things. users can buy the ability to use
                different name colors or chat colors in direct messaging groups.

                a_ch_at is designed to be a fast, free browser based chat solution with a variety of features 
                just to make it a little bit less boring than your standard chat service. a_ch_at is written entirely in HTML, CSS, and JS
                and is designed to work on Chromium based web browsers - if you're having difficulty you should switch to one of the following web browsers <br>
                - Google Chrome <br>
                - Opera <br>
                - Vivaldi <br>
                - Brave <br> 
                - Microsoft Edge Beta (note that regular Microsoft Edge may not work)
            </div>
            <div sv="Section_Development" class="Section_Hide Section">
              <h1>development</h1>
              <p>
                a_ch_at is not currently designed to be open source, although will convert to this model in the near future.
                <h3><strong>javascript</strong></h3>
                everything on the web client for a_ch_at is written in javascript. with the latest re-design, we've switched off from using jquery
                to the much smaller and similar library score for the purpose of decreasing load time and bandwidth usage.
                we also rely on several javascript libraries, such as <br>
                - jscookie <br>
                - sweetalert2 <br>
                - firebase
                <h3><strong>css (cascading style sheets)</strong></h3>
                given i'm a DEVELOPER and not a designer, don't be suprised to learn that this looks
                like complete shit. i'm always working to get better at all fields of web development, but for now,
                we're all stuck with... whatever this is.
                <h3><strong>html (hyper-text markup language)</strong></h3>
                a_ch_at's html is designed to be lightweight to reduce bandwidth and client-side load time.
                everything here was written for use on desktop based devices, including <br>
                - chromebooks <br> 
                - macbooks <br> 
                - surface <br>
                - windows desktops <br> 
                - linux desktops and laptops <br>
                - apple desktops <br>
                it wasn't designed to work on smaller devices, so don't be suprised if it doesn't. a list of devices that won't work includes <br> 
                - iphones / androids <br> 
                - ipads / tablets <br> 
                so if you're not using one of those, you're good to go. have fun!! yay!!
                <h3><strong>want to help?</strong></h3>
                if you have any experience with web development, or art design, or web design, feel free to contact me -

                a list of features a_ch_at needs to function. <br> 
                - chromium based web browser <br> 
                - javascript enabled (of course) <br> 
                - cookies enabled (we depend on cookies to make our service work)

                we won't ever disclose any information stored on our servers to anybody, save law enforcement (not sure how we'd get to there but oh well),
                and anything and everything stored on our servers is protected by AES256 (military grade) encryption. it's suggested 
                that you don't put anything very valuable or sensitive on a_ch_at, and we are not responsible for any account-related issues - ie 
                someone finds your password and you get hacked. you, as a user, are responsible for your own cyber security beyond your messages 
                being automatically encrypted, and by using this service, accept full responsiblity for any user created content (including text messages)
                that you submit while using this service.
